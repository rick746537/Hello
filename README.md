# Hello
I'm using this repository to follow the github tutorial.

I'm hoping to learn how to use git and GitHub and refine my (non existent) coding skills, for now I'm mainly focusing on c++.
In the future I wish to maybe upload a bunch of small projects of mine.
I wish to someday be capable enough to contribute to other projects as well.
